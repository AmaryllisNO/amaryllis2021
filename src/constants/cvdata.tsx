Drawing influence from Netsky, Fred V & Grafix, Camo & Krooked, Culture Shock, Logistics, and more, Amaryllis’ bright and energetic sound is a welcome addition to the Subsphere family.

    Creating everything from dubstep to orchestral music, her vast array of influence and talent is made evident in her four track EP, delivering the producers intended escapism through an incredibly immersive, bright atmosphere." - jungledrumandbass.co.uk `,
